# Welcome to SunburstJS!

![sunburst](sunburst.png)

Sunburst is fullstack JS tutorial for newbies (especially coming from FreeCodeCamp, and looking for an update to [ClementineJS](http://www.clementinejs.com/tutorials/tutorial-beginner.html)) looking to put together frontend and backend knowledge for the first time.

It uses React on the frontend, Node/Express/Mongo on the backend. Unlike ClementineJS I would use “modern” choices like create-react-app, and the mongoose ORM, and also show how to deploy to Heroku. I would also show how to integrate PassportJS for authentication.

Forum discussion here: <https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/seeking-a-mentee/168796>

The intent is to do this with a partner over a Youtube Live Stream to show how this is done in real time.

# Lesson Plan

we are going to make a persistent clicker app similar to [clementinejs](http://clementinejs.com).

1. introduction to CRA and implementing a basic clientside counter
2. setting up node and express and serving it together with CRA
3. building CRA and deploying
4. adding mongodb/mongoose to express and adding the api route. deploying.

We are done!

But here are more things we can do. lets turn this into a document posting app with different users:

5. adding redux
6. adding passportjs to express; authentication into the app.
7. adding react router including with authentication.
8. adding styling.
9. adding graphql/apollo?
